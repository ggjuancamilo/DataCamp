    "# Manipulating DataFrames with pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course Description\n",
    "In this course, you'll learn how to leverage pandas' extremely powerful data manipulation engine to get the most out of your data. You’ll learn how to drill into the data that really matters by extracting, filtering, and transforming data from DataFrames. The pandas library has many techniques that make this process efficient and intuitive. You will learn how to tidy, rearrange, and restructure your data by pivoting or melting and stacking or unstacking DataFrames. These are all fundamental next steps on the road to becoming a well-rounded data scientist, and you will have the chance to apply all the concepts you learn to real-world datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Extracting and transforming data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will learn how to index, slice, filter, and transform DataFrames using a variety of datasets, ranging from 2012 US election data for the state of Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh weather data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positional and labeled indexing\n",
    "Given a pair of label-based indices, sometimes it's necessary to find the corresponding positions. In this exercise, you will use the Pennsylvania election results again. The DataFrame is provided for you as election.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find x and y such that `election.iloc[x, y] == election.loc['Bedford', 'winner']`. That is, what is the row position of 'Bedford', and the column position of 'winner'? Remember that the first position in Python is 0, not 1!\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, first explore the DataFrame using election.head() in the IPython Shell and inspect it with your eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course introduces a lot of new concepts, so if you ever need a quick refresher, download the Pandas Cheat Sheet and keep it handy!\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore the DataFrame in the IPython Shell using election.head().\n",
    "- Assign the row position of election.loc['Bedford'] to x.\n",
    "- Assign the column position of election['winner'] to y.\n",
    "- Hit 'Submit Answer' to print the boolean equivalence of the .loc and .iloc selections."
